== Support Scripts

Various scripts are included with Evergreen in the `/openils/bin/` directory
(and in the source code in `Open-ILS/src/support-scripts` and
`Open-ILS/src/extras`). Some of them are used during
the installation process, such as `eg_db_config`, while others are usually
run as cron jobs for routine maintenance, such as `fine_generator.pl` and
`hold_targeter.pl`. Others are useful for less frequent needs, such as the
scripts for importing/exporting MARC records. You may explore these scripts
and adapt them for your local needs. You are also welcome to share your
improvements or ask any questions on the
http://evergreen-ils.org/communicate/[Evergreen IRC channel or email lists].

Here is a summary of the most commonly used scripts. The script name links
to more thorough documentation, if available.

 * <<_processing_action_triggers,action_trigger_runner.pl>>
   -- Useful for creating events for specified hooks and running pending events
 * authority_authority_linker.pl
   -- Links reference headings in authority records to main entry headings
      in other authority records. Should be run at least once a day (only for
	  changed records).
 * authority_control_fields.pl
   -- Links bibliographic records to the best matching authority record.
      Should be run at least once a day (only for changed records).
      You can accomplish this by running _authority_control_fields.pl --days-back=1_
 * autogen.sh
   -- Generates web files used by the OPAC, especially files related to
      organization unit hierarchy, fieldmapper IDL, locales selection,
      facet definitions, compressed JS files and related cache key
 * clark-kent.pl
   -- Used to start and stop the reporter (which runs scheduled reports)
 * <<_creating_the_evergreen_database,eg_db_config>>
   -- Creates database and schema, updates config files, sets Evergreen
      administrator username and password
 * fine_generator.pl
 * hold_targeter.pl
 * <<_importing_authority_records_from_command_line,marc2are.pl>>
   -- Converts authority records from MARC format to Evergreen objects
      suitable for importing via pg_loader.pl (or parallel_pg_loader.pl)
 * marc2bre.pl
   -- Converts bibliographic records from MARC format to Evergreen objects
      suitable for importing via pg_loader.pl (or parallel_pg_loader.pl)
 * marc2sre.pl
   -- Converts serial records from MARC format to Evergreen objects
      suitable for importing via pg_loader.pl (or parallel_pg_loader.pl)
 * <<_marc_export,marc_export>>
   -- Exports authority, bibliographic, and serial holdings records into
      any of these formats: USMARC, UNIMARC, XML, BRE, ARE
 * osrf_control
   -- Used to start, stop and send signals to OpenSRF services
 * parallel_pg_loader.pl
   -- Uses the output of marc2bre.pl (or similar tools) to generate the SQL
      for importing records into Evergreen in a parallel fashion

=== marc_export: Exporting Bibliographic Records into MARC files

indexterm:[marc_export]

The following procedure explains how to export Evergreen bibliographic
records into MARC files using the *marc_export* support script. All steps
should be performed by the `opensrf` user from your Evergreen server.

[NOTE]
Processing time for exporting records depends on several factors such as
the number of records you are exporting. It is recommended that you divide
the export ID files (records.txt) into a manageable number of records if
you are exporting a large number of records.

 . Create a text file list of the Bibliographic record IDs you would like
to export from Evergreen. One way to do this is using SQL:
+
[source,sql]
----
SELECT DISTINCT bre.id FROM biblio.record_entry AS bre
    JOIN asset.call_number AS acn ON acn.record = bre.id 
    WHERE bre.deleted='false' and owning_lib=101 \g /home/opensrf/records.txt;
----
+
This query creates a file called `records.txt` containing a column of
distinct IDs of items owned by the organizational unit with the id 101.

 . Navigate to the support-scripts folder
+
----
cd /home/opensrf/Evergreen-ILS*/Open-ILS/src/support-scripts/
----

 . Run *marc_export*, using the ID file you created in step 1 to define which
   files to export. The following example exports the records into MARCXML format.
+
----
cat /home/opensrf/records.txt | ./marc_export --store -i -c /openils/conf/opensrf_core.xml \
    -x /openils/conf/fm_IDL.xml -f XML --timeout 5 > exported_files.xml
----

[NOTE]
====================
`marc_export` was updated in Evergreen 2.6 and now does not output progress
as it executes.
====================

[NOTE]
====================
You can use the `--since` option to export records modified after a
certain date and time.
====================

[NOTE]
====================
By default, marc_export will use the reporter storage service, which should
work in most cases. But if you have a separate reporter database and you
know you want to talk directly to your main production database, then you
can set the `--store` option to `cstore` or `storage`. 
====================

[NOTE]
====================
For more information, run marc_export with the -h option:

 ./marc_export -h
====================



=== Importing Authority Records from Command Line

indexterm:[marc2are.pl]
indexterm:[pg_loader.pl]

The major advantages of the command line approach are its speed and its
convenience for system administrators who can perform bulk loads of
authority records in a controlled environment. For alternate instructions,
see <<_importing_authority_records_from_the_staff_client,Importing
Authority Records from the Staff Client>>.

 . Run *marc2are.pl* against the authority records, specifying the user
name, password, MARC type (USMARC or XML). Use `STDOUT` redirection to
either pipe the output directly into the next command or into an output
file for inspection. For example, to process a file with authority records
in MARCXML format named `auth_small.xml` using the default user name and
password, and directing the output into a file named `auth.are`:
+
----
cd Open-ILS/src/extras/import/
perl marc2are.pl --user admin --pass open-ils --marctype XML auth_small.xml > auth.are
----
+
[NOTE]
The MARC type will default to USMARC if the `--marctype` option is not specified.

 . Run *parallel_pg_loader.pl* to generate the SQL necessary for importing the
authority records into your system. This script will create files in your
current directory with filenames like `pg_loader-output.are.sql` and
`pg_loader-output.sql` (which runs the previous SQL file). To continue with the
previous example by processing our new `auth.are` file:
+
----
cd Open-ILS/src/extras/import/
perl parallel_pg_loader.pl --auto are --order are auth.are
----
+
[TIP]
To save time for very large batches of records, you could simply pipe the
output of *marc2are.pl* directly into *parallel_pg_loader.pl*.

 . Load the authority records from the SQL file that you generated in the
last step into your Evergreen database using the psql tool. Assuming the
default user name, host name, and database name for an Evergreen instance,
that command looks like:
+
----
psql -U evergreen -h localhost -d evergreen -f pg_loader-output.sql
----
