Tab Browser-Based Tab Buttons and Keyboard Shortcuts
----------------------------------------------------
Now that the client will be loaded in a web browser, users can use browser-based
tab controls and keyboard shortcuts to help with navigation. Below are some 
tips for browser navigation that can be used in Chrome and Firefox on Windows
PCs.

- Use CTRL-T or click the browser's new tab button to open a new tab. 
- Use CTRL-W or click the x in the tab to close the tab.
- Undo closing a tab by hitting CTRL-Shift-Tab.
- To open a link from the web client in a new tab, CTRL-click the link or 
right-click the link and select *Open Link in New Tab*. Using this method, you
can also open options from the web client's dropdown menus in a new tab
- Navigate from one tab to another using CTRL-Tab on the keyboard.

Setting New Tab Behavior
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Some users may want to automatically open the web client's portal page in a new
tab. Neither Chrome nor Firefox will open your home page by default when you
open a new tab. However, both browsers have optional add-ons that will allow you
to set the browsers to automatically open the home page whenever open opening a
new tab. These add-ons may be useful for those libraries that want the new tab
to open to the web client portal page.
