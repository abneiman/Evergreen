Copy Tags (Digital Bookplates)
------------------------------

Copy Tags allow staff to apply custom, pre-defined labels or tags to items.  Copy tags are visible in the public catalog and are searchable in both the staff client and public catalog based on configuration.  This feature was designed to be used for Digital Bookplates to attach donation or memorial information to items, but may be used for broader purposes to tag items.

Creating Copy Tags
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are two components to this feature: Copy Tag Types and Copy Tags.

Copy Tag Types are used to define the type of tag, such as “Bookplates” or “Local History Notes”, as well as the organizational unit scope for use of the tag type.

Copy Tags are associated with a Copy Tag Type and are used to configure the list of tags that can be applied to copies, such as a list of memorial or donation labels, that are applicable to a particular organizational unit.
