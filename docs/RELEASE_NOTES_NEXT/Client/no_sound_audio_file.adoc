Global option to remove sound for a specific event
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A new nosound.wav file has been added to the web client. The file can be used
to globally disable audio alerts for a specific event on an Evergreen system.

For example, to silence the alert that sounds after a successful patron search:

  * mkdir -p /openils/var/web/audio/notifications/success/patron/
  * cd /openils/var/web/audio/notifications/success/patron/
  * ln -s ../../nosound.wav by_search.wav
