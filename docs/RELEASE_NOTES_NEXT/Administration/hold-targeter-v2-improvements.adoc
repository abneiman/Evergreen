Hold Targeter V2 Repairs and Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Make the batch targeter more resilient to a single-hold failure.
* Additional batch targeter info logging.
* Set OSRF_LOG_CLIENT in hold_targeter_v2.pl for log tracing
* Removes the confusingly named --target-all option
 ** The same behavior can be achieved by using --retarget-interval "0s"
* Removes --skip-viable (see --soft-retarget-interval below)

New --next-check-interval Option
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Specify how long after the current run time the targeter will retarget
the currently affected holds. Applying a specific interval is useful
when the retarget-interval is shorter than the time between targeter
runs.

For example, if the targeter is run nightly at midnight with a
--retarget-interval 36h, you would set --next-check-interval to 48hr,
since the holds won't be processed again until 48 hours later. This
ensures that the org unit closed date checks are looking at the correct
date. 

This setting overrides the default behavior of calculating the next 
retarget time from the retarget-interval.

New --soft-retarget-interval Option
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
This is a replacement for (and rebranding of) the --skip-viable option. 
The new option allows for time-based soft-targeting instead simple binary 
on/off soft-targeting.

How soft-targeting works:
* Update hold copy maps for all affected holds
* Holds with viable targets (on the pull list) are otherwise left alone.
* Holds without viable targets are retargeted in the usual manner.
