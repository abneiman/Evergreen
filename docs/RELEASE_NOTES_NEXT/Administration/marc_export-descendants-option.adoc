New marc_export --descendants option
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The marc_export script has a new option, --descendants.  This option
takes one argument of an organizational unit shortname.  It works much
like the existing --library option except that it is aware of the
org. tree and will export records with holdings at the specified
organizational unit and all of its decendants.  This is handy if you
want to export the records for all of the branches of a system.  You
can do that by specifying this option and the system's shortname,
instead of specifying multiple --library options for each branch.

The --descendants option can be repeated, as the --library option can.
All of the specified org. units and their descendants will be included
in the output.  It can also be combined with individual --library
options when necessary.
