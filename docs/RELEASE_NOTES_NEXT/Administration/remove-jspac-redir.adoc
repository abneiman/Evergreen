Remove JSPAC Redirects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Future versions of Evergreen will no longer contain automatic redirects
from JSPAC URLs to TPAC URLs, with the exception of myopac.xml, given
that the JSPAC is no longer supported.  Existing sites, however, may
wish to retain JSPAC redirects in their Apache configuration files since
JSPAC URLs may still be used in the wild to access their catalogs.

The original JSPAC URL redirects are all retained in the file 
Open-ILS/examples/jspac_redirects.conf for reference.
