3 Day Courtesy Notice by SMS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
New optional SMS text notification to be sent out 3 days prior to the due
date of any circulating item for patrons who have an SMS text number and
carrier stored in their accounts. This action trigger is disabled by default,
but can be enabled and modified by going into Admin > Local Administration >
Notifications / Action Triggers.

You may wish to make use of granularity so that these messages are batched
and sent at the same time each day.
