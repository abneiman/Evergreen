Tweaks to Caching/Expiry of Public Catalog Assets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The default cache expiration time for static assets (e.g.,
CSS, image, and JavaScript files) in the public catalog and
the Kid's PAC has been increased to one year. Links to all
such assets now have a cache-busting value tacked on as a
query parameter. This value is refreshed when `autogen.sh` is
run, but it can also be manually set by adjusting the
`ctx.cache_key` Template Toolkit variable.
