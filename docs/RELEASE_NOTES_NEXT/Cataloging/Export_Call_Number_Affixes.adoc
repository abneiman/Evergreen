Include Call Number Prefixes and Suffixes in Export and Z39.50 output
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The call number prefix and suffix, when present, are now included in
subfields $k and $m of the 852 field when running `marc_export` with
the `--items` switch. Similarly, when using Evergreen as a Z39.50
server configured to embed item data in 852 fields, the affixes are now
included in subfields $k and $m.
