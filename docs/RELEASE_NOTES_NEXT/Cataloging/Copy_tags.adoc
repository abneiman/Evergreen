Copy Tags and Digital Bookplates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Copy tags will allow staff to apply custom, pre-defined labels or tags
to copies.  Copy tags are searchable in both the staff client and public
catalog.  This feature was designed to be used for Digital Bookplates to
attach donation or memorial information to copies, but may be used for
broader purposes to tag items.

Each copy tag can either be publicly-visible or visible only to staff.
Copy tags also have types that can be used for restricting catalog
searches on copy tags to particular types.

Copy tags are displayed in the copy table in the record summary page in
the public catalog, and a new library setting can be used to add
a "Digital Bookplate" search field.  Copy tags can also be used
as a search filter, e.g.,

  * `copy_tag(bookplate, jane smith)`: search for records that have a
    copy tag of type `bookplate` whose value contains `jane smith`.
  * `copy_tag(*, jane smith)`: search for records that have a
    copy tag of any type whose value contains `jane smith`.

All staff-side interfaces related to copy tags exist only in the web
staff client.  There are two new administration interfaces for managing
copy tags and copy tag types. The copy editor now has a `Copy Tags`
button for applying copy tags to copies; that interface can also be
used to create new copy tags on the fly. Furthermore, the copy buckets
interface now has an `Apply Tags` action for assigning tags to groups
of copies.

Permissions
+++++++++++

Two new permission are included:

  * `ADMIN_COPY_TAG_TYPES`: required to create a new tag type under
     Server Administration->Copy Tag Types
  * `ADMIN_COPY_TAG`: required to create a new tag under
    Local Administration->Copy Tags

The existing permission `UPDATE_COPY` controls whether or not a user
can link copies to tags.

Library Settings
++++++++++++++++
A new library setting, "Enable Digital Bookplate Search", controls
whether to display a "Digital Bookplate" field in the search index
drop-downs in the catalog. A "Digital Bookplate" search will include
all records that have a copy that matches the tag specified by the user.
It should be noted that this library settings does not affect the
display of copy tags on the catalog record summary page.
