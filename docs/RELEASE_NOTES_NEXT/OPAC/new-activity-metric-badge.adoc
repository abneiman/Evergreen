New Popularity Parameter
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
New popularity parameters for in-house use over time and for count of distinct
organizational units that own a title are now available. Evergreen sites
can use these parameters to create new statistical popularity badges for
sorting in the catalog by Most Popular or by Popularity-Adjusted Relevance.

The in-house use parameters will apply a badge to titles that have the most
in-house use activity over time. The organizational unit count parameter
will apply a badge to titles owned by the most number of libraries in a
consortium. Ownership is determined by the copy's circulation library.
