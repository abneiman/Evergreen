Download Checkout History CSV Fixed for Large Number of Circulations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Downloading checkout history as a CSV from My Account has been fixed
for users with a large circulation history.  Previously, this would
time out for patrons with more than 100 or so circulations.

This feature no longer uses the action/trigger mechanism and the OPAC
now generates the CSV directly.  The old action/trigger code is still
present in the database and should be removed at some point in the
near future.
