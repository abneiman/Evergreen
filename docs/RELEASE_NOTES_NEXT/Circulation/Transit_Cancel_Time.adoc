Transit Cancel Time and Terminology Change
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Transit Cancel Time
+++++++++++++++++++

Previously, Evergreen deleted canceled (aborted) transits from the database.  Now
the rows in action.transit_copy, action.hold_transit_copy, and action.reservation_transit_copy
are preserved in the database, though still not visible to the end user in the staff client.
This allows for better tracking of when transits are canceled for the purposes of knowing
which staff member canceled the transit, etc.

NOTE: This change may require the re-creation of transit reports to filter out canceled
transits from the results.  Cloning the template and adding a Base Filter of Cancel Time 
Is NULL will suffice.

"Canceled Transit" Terminology Change
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The term "abort" has been replaced with "cancel" in all of the affected user interfaces.
For internal continuity, however, the following permission codes have not changed:

 * ABORT_TRANSIT
 * ABORT_REMOTE_TRANSIT
 * ABORT_TRANSIT_ON_LOST
 * ABORT_TRANSIT_ON_MISSING
