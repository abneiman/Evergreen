Patron Search from Place Hold
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Patron Search from Place Hold allows staff members, when placing a
hold on behalf of a patron in the web staff client, to search for
patrons by names and other searchable patron information, rather than
relying on barcode alone. In particular, after performing a catalog
search or going to a specific bib record and clicking the 'Place Hold'
button, the form now includes a 'Patron Search' button. This button
will open a dialog allowing the staff member search for and select
a patron record.
