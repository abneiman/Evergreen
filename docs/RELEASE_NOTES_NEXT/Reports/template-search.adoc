Reports Template Searching
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A new form appears along the top of the reports interface for searching
report templates.  Once found, typical template actions (e.g. create new
report) are available from within the results interface.

Searches may be performed across selected (visible) folders or all 
folders visible to the logged in user.

Searches are case-insensitive, any word order, with left-anchored words.  
All searched words must appear in at least one of the searched fields.

Examples
++++++++

 * Searching for 'stat cat' matches:
  ** stat cat
  ** statistical category
  ** categories, statistical
  ** patrons (stat cat)
 * Searching for 'stat cat' does not match:
  ** stat 
   *** both words must be present in the searched field(s)
  ** stat location
    *** location contains 'cat' but it's not left-anchored.

Reporter Paging
+++++++++++++++

The templates, reports, and output interfaces now support paging via 
new 'Next', 'Prev', and 'Start' links next to the output limit selector.
