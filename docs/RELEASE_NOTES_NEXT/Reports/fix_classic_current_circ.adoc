Fix to reporter.classic_current_circ view
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The `reporter.classic_current_circ` view, which is part of some
extra views defined in `Open-ILS/src/sql/Pg/example.reporter-extension.sql`,
has been fixed to not exclude loans for patrons who do not have a
billing address set. Users of this view should rerun
`Open-ILS/src/sql/Pg/example.reporter-extension.sql` during upgrade.
