Evergreen 3.2 Release Notes
===========================
:toc:
:numbered:

Upgrade notes
-------------

Disabling of Legacy XUL Staff Client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The legacy XUL staff client is no longer supported in Evergreen
3.2.x and the server-side installation no longer supports a
direct connection by a version XUL client by default.  *All
users of Evergreen 3.2.x are strongly urged to complete their
switch to the web staff client as part of upgrading to 3.2.x.*

Evergreen administrators who for some reason continue to wish
to deploy the XUL staff client can do so at their risk by
supplying `STAFF_CLIENT_STAMP_ID` during the `make install` step
and using `make_release` to create installers for the staff client.
However, no community support will be provided for the XUL client.



Acq Invoice Reports
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Existing Acquisitions report templates that reference the invoice 'complete'
field should be modified to check whether the new close_date field is NOT NULL
instead.

At deploy time, all invoices with a 'complete' value of TRUE will have their
'close_date' field set to NOW.  A value is required, since this field is
now the source of whether an invoice is open or closed.

However, no values will be applied to the closed_by field for already closed
invoices.


Angular6 Base Application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

System Admin Upgrade Notes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Like the AngularJS application, Evergreen releases will come with all
web browser staff client code pre-compiled.  Admins only need to add an
Apache configuration change.

Add the following stanza to /etc/apache2/eg_vhost.conf.

[source,conf]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI}  ^/eg2/
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI}  !^/eg2/([a-z]{2}-[A-Z]{2})/
RewriteRule ^/eg2/(.*) https://%{HTTP_HOST}/eg2/en-US/$1 [R=307,L]

<Directory "/openils/var/web/eg2/en-US">
    FallbackResource /eg2/en-US/index.html
</Directory>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

For multi-locale sites, see the bottom section of
Open-ILS/examples/apache[_24]/eg_vhost.conf.in for a sample fr-CA
configuration.  The section starts with "/eg2/ client setup and locale
configuration"

Developer Upgrade Notes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Developers building Angular code on existing installations need to update
their version of NodeJS by re-running the -developer prereqs installer.

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
sudo make -f Open-ILS/src/extras/Makefile.install <osname>-developer
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


Asynchronous Vandelay Imports
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Users of NGINX as a reverse proxy may need to set a suitable
`client_max_body_size` value in the NGINX configuration so that large
MARC record uploads are not truncated. Note that this would have
always been necessary, but since this feature allows larger files
to be more reliably queued and imported, the need to set `client_max_body_size`
became more apparent.


Browser Client Settings & Preferences Stored on the Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A new permission APPLY_WORKSTATION_SETTING has been added to control who
may apply values to workstation settings.  Use something like the following
to apply the permission to all staff accounts (mileage may vary):

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSERT INTO permission.grp_perm_map (grp, perm, depth)
VALUES (
    (SELECT id FROM permission.grp_tree WHERE name = 'Staff'), -- name may vary
    (SELECT id FROM permission.perm_list WHERE code =
'APPLY_WORKSTATION_SETTING'),
    0 -- or 1, 2, etc.
);
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Workstation setting types matching values previously stored in the browser
(via localStorage or Hatch) are created as part of this feature.  During
upgrade, admins should consider whether any of these new setting types
should be transferred to user and/or org unit settings instead.  Setting
type changes can be made at any time, but when a setting type is deleted
all of its data is deleted, so a change in type means re-applying the
settings in the browser client.

Values stored in the browser will automatically migrate to server settings
as each setting is accessed in the browser client.  Once migrated, the
in-browser copies are deleted.

If a setting type does not exist where the browser expects one, the
value is stored in-browser instead and a warning is issued in the console.




New Features
------------


Acquisitions
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Auto-Cancel Line items When All Copies Are Canceled
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
When a copy (line item detail) is canceled through the Acquisitions interface, 
the parent line item is also canceled if all copies for that line item are also 
canceled.  The cancel reason given will come from:

. The cancel reason for the just-canceled copy if it's a Keep Debits true 
cancel reason.
. The cancel reason from any other copy on the lineitem that has a Keep 
Debits true cancel reason.
. The cancel reason for the just-canceled copy if no copies have a Keep
Debits true cancel reason.


Invoice Closed Date and Closed By Fields
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Acquisitions invoices have 2 new fields:

* Close Date -- This is set to the time when the ACQ user clicks the "Close"
  button in the invoice interface.
  ** This field 'replaces' the existing 'complete' field.  An invoice is
     considered complete if a close date value is set.
* Closed By -- This is set to the logged in staff user who performs the 
  "Close" action.

As with the now-defunct 'complete' field, but new fields are cleared in the 
event an invoice is reopened.

These new fields are visible in the invoice interface under the 
'Show Details' action for closed invoices.

Upgrading Invoice Reports
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

Existing report templates that reference the invoice 'complete' field 
should be modified to check whether the new close_date field is NOT NULL
instead.

Other Upgrade Considerations
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

At deploy time, all invoices with a 'complete' value of TRUE will have their
'close_date' field set to NOW.  A value is required, since this field is
now the source of whether an invoice is open or closed.

However, no values will be applied to the closed_by field for already closed
invoices.



Patron Acquisitions Requests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The existing interface for staff-mediated patron acquisition requests has been replaced in the web staff client with a re-implementation written in AngularJS, with some minor bug fixes (including access from the Patron interface) and other improvements.



Administration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hold Targeter Script has been Replaced
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The original hold_targeter.pl script has been renamed to
"hold_targeter_legacy.pl", and the new-style hold targeting
script has been renamed to "hold_targeter.pl".  Administrators
will want to change their crontab files to reflect this.

.Previous Syntax
[source,bash]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
-*/15 * * * *   . ~/.bashrc && $EG_BIN_DIR/hold_targeter.pl $SRF_CORE
---------------------------------------------------------------------

.New Syntax
[source,bash]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-*/15 * * * *   . ~/.bashrc && $EG_BIN_DIR/hold_targeter.pl --osrf-config
$SRF_CORE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The sample crontab file at `Open-ILS/examples/crontab.example` reflects
this change.



Architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Angular6 Base Application
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
With Evergreen 3.2, we introduce the initial infrastructure for
migrating to a new version of Angular.  The structure of the new code
is quite different from the AngularJS code and it runs as a separate
application which communicates with the AngularJS app via shared storage
and in-page URLs that link back and forth between the two.

For this release, users will only be directed to the new Angular site
when navigating to Administration => Acquisitions Administration.  Once
on this page, some of the admin interfaces will presented as Angular6
interfaces, while others will direct users back to the AngularJS
application.  The Angular6 interfaces are the simpler, grid-based
interfaces.

Acquisitions Admin Angular6 Interfaces
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 * Cancel Reasons
 * Claim Event Types
 * Claim Policies
 * Claim Policy Actions
 * Claim Types
 * Currency Types
 * EDI Accounts
 * EDI Messages
 * Exchange Rates
 * Fund Tags
 * Invoice Item Types
 * Invoice Payment Method
 * Line Item Alerts
 * Line Item MARC Attribute Definitions

System Admin Upgrade Notes
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Like the AngularJS application, Evergreen releases will come with all
web browser staff client code pre-compiled.  Admins only need to add an
Apache configuration change.

Add the following stanza to /etc/apache2/eg_vhost.conf.

[source,conf]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI}  ^/eg2/
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI}  !^/eg2/([a-z]{2}-[A-Z]{2})/
RewriteRule ^/eg2/(.*) https://%{HTTP_HOST}/eg2/en-US/$1 [R=307,L]

<Directory "/openils/var/web/eg2/en-US">                                       
    FallbackResource /eg2/en-US/index.html                                     
</Directory>  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

For multi-locale sites, see the bottom section of
Open-ILS/examples/apache[_24]/eg_vhost.conf.in for a sample fr-CA
configuration.  The section starts with "/eg2/ client setup and locale
configuration"

Developer Upgrade Notes
+++++++++++++++++++++++

Developers building Angular code on existing installations need to update 
their version of NodeJS by re-running the -developer prereqs installer.

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
sudo make -f Open-ILS/src/extras/Makefile.install <osname>-developer
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


Cataloging
~~~~~~~~~~

Add UPC to z39.50 search for OCLC and LOC
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Add UPC as a search attribute for both OCLC and LOC targets in
z39.50 for cataloging.


Asynchronous Vandelay Imports
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Vandelay imports are now monitored from the browser client asynchronously,
meaning the client requests updates from the server instead of waiting for 
the server to respond to the original import request.  This changes allows 
for incremental progress updates in the browser client.

New Database Table
++++++++++++++++++

This adds a new database table vandelay.session_tracker for tracking
in-progress vandelay upload activity.  A new tracker row is added for
each of "upload", "enqueue", and "import" actions, linked for a given
session by the value stored in the "session_key" field.

The table tracks other potentially useful data, like the staff member
and workstation where the action was performed.

Upgrade notes
+++++++++++++
Users of NGINX as a reverse proxy may need to set a suitable
`client_max_body_size` value in the NGINX configuration so that large
MARC record uploads are not truncated. Note that this would have
always been necessary, but since this feature allows larger files
to be more reliably queued and imported, the need to set `client_max_body_size`
became more apparent.




Support for Last Inventory Date
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Evergreen now provides an option to add an inventory date to items to facilitate
the process of performing inventory in libraries. Staff can add an inventory
date to an item in one of the following ways:
 * From the check in screen, there is now an Update Inventory check in modifier.
When selected, scanned barcodes will have the current date/time added as the
inventory date while the item is checked in.
 * From the Item Status screen, an action is available to add the current 
date/time as the inventory date to selected items.

This new feature will also store the workstation that was used when the
inventory date was updated.



Parallel Ingest with pingest.pl
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A program named pingest.pl is now installed to allow faster bibliographic record
ingest.  It performs ingest in parallel so that multiple batches can
be done simultaneously.  It operates by splitting the records to be
ingested up into batches and running all of the ingest methods on each
batch.  You may pass in options to control how many batches are run at
the same time, how many records there are per batch, and which ingest
operations to skip.

NOTE: The browse ingest is presently done in a single process over all
of the input records as it cannot run in parallel with itself.  It
does, however, run in parallel with the other ingests.

Command Line Options
++++++++++++++++++++
pingest.pl accepts the following command line options:

--host::
    The server where PostgreSQL runs (either host name or IP address).
    The default is read from the PGHOST environment variable or
    "localhost."

--port::
    The port that PostgreSQL listens to on host.  The default is read
    from the PGPORT environment variable or 5432.

--db::
    The database to connect to on the host.  The default is read from
    the PGDATABASE environment variable or "evergreen."

--user::
    The username for database connections.  The default is read from
    the PGUSER environment variable or "evergreen."

--password::
    The password for database connections.  The default is read from
    the PGPASSWORD environment variable or "evergreen."

--batch-size::
    Number of records to process per batch.  The default is 10,000.

--max-child::
    Max number of worker processes (i.e. the number of batches to
    process simultaneously).  The default is 8.

--skip-browse::
--skip-attrs::
--skip-search::
--skip-facets::
--skip-display::
    Skip the selected reingest component.

--start-id::
    Start processing at this record ID.

--end-id::
    Stop processing when this record ID is reached.

--pipe::
    Read record IDs to reingest from standard input.  This option
    conflicts with --start-id and/or --end-id.

--max-duration::
    Stop processing after this many total seconds have passed.  The
    default is to run until all records have been processed.

--help::
    Show the help text.



View Authority Record by Database ID
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A new interface allows catalogers to retrieve a specific
authority record using its database ID.  Catalogers can
find those IDs in subfield $0 of matching fields in
bibliographic records.

To use the new authority record viewer:

. Click *Cataloging -> Retrieve Authority Record by ID*.
. Type in the ID number of the authority record you are
interested in. Don't include any prefixes, just the ID
number.
. Click *Submit*.
. View or edit the authority record as needed.



Circulation
~~~~~~~~~~~



Autorenewal of Loans
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Circulation policies in Evergreen can now be configured to automatically renew
certain items checked out on patron accounts. Circulations will be renewed
automatically up to a custom limit (the `max_auto_renewal` field) and patrons
will not need to log in to their OPAC accounts or ask library staff to manually
renew materials.

Two new action triggers have been added to Evergreen that permit the Auto-Renew
feature. They can be found, configured, and enabled in Administration>Local
Administration>Notifications/Action Triggers. They are named **Autorenew** and
**AutorenewNotify**.

The **Autorenew** A/T definition uses the `checkout.due` hook to automatically
validate and renew (in the reactor) circulations on the day they are due,
grouped by user. The output events of this definition is is the input used by
the related **AutorenewNotify** A/T that simply uses a new hook called
`autorenewal` to notify patrons via email of their currently due or
auto-renewed items.

In the webstaff's Patron Items Out page, the new column `AutoRenewalsRemaining`
indicates how many autorenewals are available for a particular circulation.





Emergency Closing Handler
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Staff are provided with interfaces and mechanisms to create library closings
that, in addition to affecting future circulation and booking due dates, and
hold shelf expirations, will automatically move existing circulation and booking
due dates and hold shelf expiration times. This new functionality is
conceptually described as Emergency Closings and business logic implementing it
as the Emergency Closing Handler. It contains additions and adjustments to the
user interface, business logic, and database layers. Access to this
functionality is available through the Closed Dates Editor interface in the
staff client which has been ported to AngularJS.

Overview
++++++++

This development has created new business logic code to inspect, in real time,
existing circulation, booking, and hold records, and modify such date and time
stamps so that the circulation, booking, or hold will end in the same state it
would have if the closing had existed at the time the circulation or booking
occurred, or the hold was placed and captured. Of specific note, hourly loans
will have their due date adjusted to be the end of the day following the
closing.

When the Emergency Closing is saved, any fines accrued during the closing may be
voided, as settings dictate, with the exception of circulations that have been
marked as LOST or LONG OVERDUE. That is, even for LOST and LONG OVERDUE
circulations with due dates that fall within the Emergency Closing, no fine
adjustment will be applied. Emergency Closing processing is permanent, and
cannot be rolled back.

This functionality is explicitly initiated by staff action. If staff do not
request an Emergency Closing, existing circulations, bookings, and holds will
not be processed and adjusted. However, if staff request any Closing that starts
nearer in time than the length of the longest circulation duration configured
for use in the Evergreen instance they will be prompted with the option to
create the closing as an Emergency Closing.

Action/Trigger hooks have been created for circulations and bookings that are
adjusted by the Emergency Closing Handler. These will facilitate the creation of
notifications to patrons that the due date has changed and to alert them to
potential changes in accrued fines.

Booking start dates are explicitly ignored in this implementation. Because an
Emergency Closing is, by its nature, an unexpected event, it will be up to staff
to address any bookings which intersect with a new Emergency Closings. Reports
can be used to identify booking start dates that overlap with a closing and that
may require staff intervention.

Staff requesting and Emergency Closing must have the new EMERGENCY_CLOSING
permission.  Some text describing the feature.





Patron Preferred Name and Name Search Keywords
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Preferred Name
++++++++++++++

Adds a new set of patron preferred name fields for prefix, first,
middle, last, and suffix allowing patrons to provide preferred name
information.  Preferred names are optional and each acts as an overlay
to the analogous primary name field, making it possible to provide
preferred name values for individual fields.

For example, a patron named William Erickson may have a preferred first
name (pref_first_given_name) of Bill, in which case the preferred name
would be Bill Erickson.  Note a preferred last name is not required in
this case as the code uses primary name values as defaults when not
replaced with a preferred version.

* Patrons will see primary names displayed in the catalog when set.
* Staff will see both primary name and preferred name in the patron
  summary side bar.
* Patron searches for any given name field will search both the primary
  and preferred name data.
* Preferred name fields are available in Action/Trigger templates and
  are present in various patron-focused print templates.

Name Keywords
++++++++++++++

Adds a new field to store miscellaneous patron name search terms.  These
values are only for searching and do not appear in any interfaces, apart
from the patron summary side bar and the patron edit UI.

Included is a new search field in the patron search UI which searches
keyword values and all other name fields.  It's essentially a global patron
name keyword search.




Client
~~~~~~

Disabling of legacy XUL staff client
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The legacy XUL staff client is no longer supported in Evergreen
3.2.x and the server-side installation no longer supports a
direct connection by a version XUL client by default.  All
users of Evergreen 3.2.x are strongly urged to complete their
switch to the web staff client as part of upgrading to 3.2.x.

Evergreen administrators who for some reason continue to wish
to deploy the XUL staff client can do so at their risk by
supplying `STAFF_CLIENT_STAMP_ID` during the `make install` step
and using `make_release` to create installers for the staff client.
However, no community support will be provided for the XUL client.




Permission Group Display Entries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In some cases, it is useful to have the ability to reorder permission, or to make
only specific groups available in the permission group selector for specific
Org Units. An interface has been made available to allow this.

Group Tree Display Entry Interface
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Permission Group Display Entries can be reordered, added, or removed via
_Administration -> Local Admin -> Permission Tree Display Entries_.
Select the Org Unit you wish to edit the entries in.

Entries may be added using the Add functionality, creating entries based
on permission groups that have not been added to the tree for the Org
Unit you wish to add them to.

image::media/pgtde_01.png[Group Tree Display Entry Admin UI]

Moving an Entry
+++++++++++++++
Moving an entry will shift its position up or down in the patron profile
selector for a given Org Unit.

* Select an entry
* Press either the *Move Up* or *Move Down* button. The entry will be 
moved up or down, accordingly.
* Click *Save* to save your edits.  

NOTE: You may only move up or down entries that have sibling entries.

Removing an Entry
+++++++++++++++++
If you want a particular Org Unit to not have access to specific
entries, you may remove an entry. Removing an entry will remove it from 
view. The entry will be removed from the database.

* Select an entry and press the *Remove* button.

Adding an Entry
+++++++++++++++
You may add entries from permission groups that are not currently
reflected in the permission group tree. This is useful for moving 
entries to different parents, or making them root entries.

image::media/pgtde_02.png[Add Entry modal]

* If desired, select an entry to be used as the parent entry. 
* Press the *Add* button. 
* Select a permission group from the dropdown.
* If you've selected a parent entry, you may check the *Add Root Entry*
box to override that parent and add the entry on the root level. 
* If you did not select a parent entry, the entry will be added on the root 
level of the tree.



Browser Client Settings & Preferences Stored on the Server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Browser client settings and preferences that should persist over time are
now stored as settings on the server.  This allows settings to follow
users and workstations and reduces problems associated with losing settings 
as a result of clearing browser data.

The browser client honors setting values stored as user settings, workstation
settings, and org unit settings, depending on which setting types are
locally configured.

Setting Types
+++++++++++++

* No setting can be both a user and workstation setting.  They are mutually
  exclusive.
* Any setting can be an org unit setting in addition to being a user or
  workstation setting.

Read-Only Settings
++++++++++++++++++

Read-only settings are useful for defining values that staff can use but
not modify.  For example, admins may wish to prevent users from locally
modifying the grid configuration for a given interface so it remains
consistent for all users.

A setting is read-only when an org unit setting type exists (regardless of 
whether a value is applied) and no user or workstation setting type exists.

Server-Stored Workstation Settings Workstation Admin View
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

There's a new "Server Workstation Prefs" tab to the stored preferences
workstation admin interface.  From here, users can view which
preferences are stored as server-stored workstation preferences and
delete select values.

Upgrade Notes
+++++++++++++

A new permission APPLY_WORKSTATION_SETTING has been added to control who
may apply values to workstation settings.  Use something like the following
to apply the permission to all staff accounts (mileage may vary):

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSERT INTO permission.grp_perm_map (grp, perm, depth) 
VALUES (
    (SELECT id FROM permission.grp_tree WHERE name = 'Staff'), -- name may vary
    (SELECT id FROM permission.perm_list WHERE code = 'APPLY_WORKSTATION_SETTING'),
    0 -- or 1, 2, etc.
);
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Workstation setting types matching values previously stored in the browser
(via localStorage or Hatch) are created as part of this feature.  During
upgrade, admins should consider whether any of these new setting types 
should be transferred to user and/or org unit settings instead.  Setting
type changes can be made at any time, but when a setting type is deleted
all of its data is deleted, so a change in type means re-applying the 
settings in the browser client.

Values stored in the browser will automatically migrate to server settings
as each setting is accessed in the browser client.  Once migrated, the
in-browser copies are deleted.  

If a setting type does not exist where the browser expects one, the 
value is stored in-browser instead and a warning is issued in the console.


More consistent terminology in the client
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Terminology has been updated in the staff client so that we consistently use
the same name to describe the same thing. The following updates have been made:

  * The term 'item' is now consistently used to describe the barcoded entity
that had been previously been called both an 'item' and a 'copy'. As a result,
we now use the terms 'item buckets', 'item tags', and 'item alerts'.
  * The term 'volume' is no longer used in the client, with the exception of
serials, where the term is used to describe serial volumes. The term 'call
number' will replace volume in most other places.
  *'Holdings' is a more general term used to describe a combination of items
and call numbers.
  * The term 'Shelving Location' is used consistently in favor of 'Copy
Location.'




OPAC
~~~~



Batch Actions In the Public Catalog
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The public catalog now displays checkboxes on the bibliographic and
metarecord constituents results pages. Selecting one or more titles
by using the checkboxes will dynamically add those title to the
temporary list, which is now renamed the cart.

Above the results lists there is now a bar with a select-all checkbox,
a link to the cart management page that also indicates the number of
of titles in the cart, and a link to remove from the cart titles that
are selected on the currently displayed results page.

The search bar now includes an icon of a cart and displays the number
of titles currently in the cart. Next to that icon is a menu of cart
actions.

The cart actions available are Place Hold, Print Title Details,
Email Title Details, Add Cart to Saved List, and Clear Cart. In the
web staff client, the cart actions also include Add Cart to Bucket.
When an action is selected from this menu, the user is given an
opportunity to confirm the action and to optionally empty the cart
when the action is complete. The action is applied to all titles
in the cart.

Clicking on the cart icon brings the user to a page listing the
titles in the cart. From there, the user can select specific records
to request, print, email, add to a list, or remove from the cart.

The list of actions on the record details page now provides separate
links for adding the title to a cart or to a permanent list.

The permanent list management page in the public catalog now also
includes batch print and email actions.

Additional information
++++++++++++++++++++++
* The checkboxes do not display on the metarecord results page, as
  metarecords currently cannot be put into carts or lists.
* The checkboxes are displayed only if JavaScript is enabled. However,
  users can still add items to the cart and perform batch actions on
  the cart and on lists.
* A template `config.tt2` setting, `ctx.max_cart_size`, can be used to
  set a soft limit on the number of titles that can be added to the
  cart. If this limit is reached, checkboxes to add more records to the
  cart are disabled unless existing titles in the cart are removed
  first. The default value for this setting is 500.

Developer notes
+++++++++++++++

This patch adds to the public catalog two routes that return JSON
rather than HTML:

* `GET /eg/opac/api/mylist/add?record=45`
* `GET /eg/opac/api/mylist/delete?record=45`

The JSON response is a hash containing a mylist key pointing to the list
of bib IDs of contents of the cart.

The record parameter can be repeated to allow adding or removing
records as an atomic operation. Note that this change also now available
to `/eg/opac/mylist/{add,delete}`

More generally, this adds a way for EGWeb context loaders to specify that
a response should be emitted as JSON rather than rendering an HTML
page using `Template::Toolkit`.

Specifically, if the context as munged by the context loader contains
a `json_response` key, the contents of that key will to provide a
JSON response. The `json_response_cookie` key, if present, can be used
to set a cookie as part of the response.

Template Toolkit processing is bypassed entirely when emitting a JSON
response, so the context loader would be entirely responsible for
localization of strings in the response meant for direct human
consumption.




New class for searchbar when on the homepage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This adds the `.searchbar-home` class to the div that contains the searchbar
when on the homepage.  This allows sites to customize the searchbar differently
on the homepage than in other places the search bar appears (for example,
offering a large, Google-style search bar on the homepage only).


Username Login Hint
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To make customization easier, the username hint on the OPAC login page ("Please
include leading zeros...") has been moved to a separate TT2 template.  If you
have customized the hint text, you will need to add your modifications to
username_hint.tt2.
